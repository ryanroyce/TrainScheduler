# TrainScheduler

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulate this information using Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.


## The Problem
* Storing information into Firebase.
* Converting an integer into UNIX time and back again.

## How I solved it
Firebase was pretty simple to navigate. Google's design and help tools are very helpful and intuitive to use. 

Reading through the moment documenation was pretty extensive but with persistence I was able to figure out how to take a specific time, convert it to UNIX time and store all of it in Firebase.

Having a good knowledge of how jQuery and Javascript worked to create these functions was key.
## Technologies Used
* Bootstrap
